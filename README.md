# gas
I am building visual gas trackers with a user-friendly interface. This is a first prototype that anyone, especially the Linea Voyage questers, are free to use for their convenience.

The existing trackers support limited amount of chains and don't allow to examine the charts in detail, if any chart is provided at all. 
This simple tracker makes the best use of `PlotLy` and `web3.py` to create a readable, analyzable graph. 

Knowledge is power. Optimize your transaction time. Identify sybil attacks.
